   I have used Mono<Any> here as a return type since we are not used any Database to store the data or service class to return particular object , so  i didnt use Model/pojo     class as a return type.
 
 # Services
 
   # 1.Charging Service 
      
     -call to EV-Charging Station Using Api key (Access error due to RBAC )
      so
     -call to Petrol Stations Using Api key
     
   # 2.Parking facility Service 
      
     -call to On-Street Parking Using Api key (Access error due to RBAC )
      so
     -call to Petrol Stations Using Api key

 # Microservice Call to discover nearby places /getdata/{location}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 this rest api will parallel call to HERE MAP rest API's to get nearby location Services under categories of
             
             1.PETROL STATION  under  Charging Station API Service
             2.EAT DRINK  under   Eat Drink Api Service
             3.SHOPPING  under  Parking Facility Api Service

 # Microservice parrallel calls with location as parameter to return 3 nearest POI's

       localhost:8761/getdata/52.5166,13.3778          // 52.5166,13.3778 -> location parameter need to be passed default size is 3
 
 # Microservice calls with location as parameter and size as parameter
  
       localhost:8761/getdata/52.5166,13.3778/1        // 52.5166,13.3778 -> location parameter and 1 is size
       
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # Microservice Call to Vehicle Connected Service /getVCS/{location}
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 this rest api will parallel call to HERE MAP rest API's to get nearby location Services under categories of
             
             1.On-Street Parking  under  Parking Facility Api Service
             2.Off-Street Parking  under  Eat Drink Api Service
             3.EV-Charging-Station  under  Charging Station API Service

 # Microservice parrallel calls with location as parameter to return 3 nearest POI's

       localhost:8761/getVCS/52.5166,13.3778          // 52.5166,13.3778 -> location parameter need to be passed default size is 3
      
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
 # Microservice Call to Vehicle Connected Service /hello
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sends rest calls to three microservices to know whether services are up, which returns hello message from all services
 
       localhost:8761/hello 
 
 # Zuul Gateway Proxy
   
   All the MicroService call ports are Mapped to zuul gateway under 8080, so that 8080 port can access microservice mapped rest API's
     
       example url :http://localhost:8080/parking-facility/get?at=52.5164%2C13.3742&cat=shopping&size=3

  # Spring cache
   
   To avoid multiple calls to the provider(Here Maps) the response is ideally cached in memory,Response will be cached for parrallel calls and as well as standalone services.
   CacheEvict is Scheduled to clear caches frequently with timelimit
